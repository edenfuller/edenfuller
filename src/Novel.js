          <em>The Dweller's House</em> is a science fiction novel about
          interstellar youth missionaries. It combines an ensemble adventure and
          robust LGBTQ+ cast with a deep critique of religious proselytization
          and savior narratives. The book draws on five years of my experience
          as a teenage missionary with major evangelical organizations.
